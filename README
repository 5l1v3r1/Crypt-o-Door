Use this tool at your own Risk.
I take no responsibility For it's use, 
or the actions of it's users. This is meant
 to be used as a TOOL for secure vulnerability research only!
<----- End Disclaimer ----->


<----- Info ----->
This tool was build using python2.7, along with the M2Crypto Library
Other versions of python Might work, but you'll need M2Crypto.
This was only tested on Linux, it might work on windows... I probably 
won't get to it for a month or two if it doesn't... so wait for v2.0 =)
<----- End Info ----->

<----- Usage ----->
./generate.py

What it will do:
	-Will generate two unique RSA Key pairs.
	-Will make every shell tied to it's unique backdoor
	-Will output CLI.py and shell.php
Now:
	-Just upload shell.php to a webserver
	-Call up CLI.py --host=shurikenlabs.com --path=/shell.php
Then:	
	-Profit?
<----- End Usage ----->


<----- ToDo ----->
1.) Impliment PHP driven RSA encrypt, and Decrypt functions 
	-(removing OpenSSL as a dependancy)

2.) Create self decrypting backdoor on runtime.
	
3.) Create a tool that logs mod_php's exec calls,so we'll actually be able to easily detect the use of web backdoors.
	
4.) RSA Stateful-shell? (think ssh over php)
	
5.) The ability to issue out new keys during operation.
<----- End ToDo ----->
